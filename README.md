How It's Made:

Tech used: MongoDB, Node.js, & Express.js

This full stack web app provides access upon clicking entering on the name of a species and clicking the 'get info' button to information about said species that inhabits the Star Trek universe. Said informations resides on MongoDB. This app was built out using MongoDB, Node.js and Express.js.

Optimizations

Adding additional species is a potential optimization, but a better one would adding a means to select the species that provides all of the options, such as a drop-down menu.

Lessons Learned:
Entering the document data into MongoDB really reminded me of the importance of using a programmatic way to insert document data into databases.
